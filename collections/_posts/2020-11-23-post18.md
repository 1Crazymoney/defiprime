## üî• The DeFi Bulletin

*   Amid a spate of flash loan attacks in DeFi lately, leading decentralized oracle network Chainlink published a blog post on [tamper-proof oracles](https://blog.chain.link/flash-loans-and-the-importance-of-tamper-proof-oracles/) and why these solutions are key to preventing price oracle attacks. 
*   The team behind the up-and-coming yield aggregator project [Idle Finance](https://idlefinance.medium.com/idle-raises-1-2m-to-scale-its-yield-optimization-protocol-6adfa5f536af) just raised $1.2 million in a new funding round. 
*   Synthetix‚Äôs Kain Warwick published an excellent overview of [Virtual Synths](https://blog.synthetix.io/virtual-synths/). 
*   Ethereum development studio ConsenSys acquired dapp toolmaker startup [Truffle Suite](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/amp/linked/84857/consensys-acquisition-truffle-suite-dapp-ethereum?__twitter_impression=true). 
*   State channels project Connext unveiled [Vector](https://medium.com/connext/instant-cross-l2-transfers-are-now-on-testnet-2f1295530c22), a cross-chain routing network set to streamline interactions among L1 and L2 projects. 
*   You can now lend directly through [Ledger Live](https://blog.synthetix.io/virtual-synths/) thanks to a new collaboration between hardware wallet maker Ledger and popular DeFi lending protocol Compound.
*   Yam Finance introduced [Umbrella Protocol](https://medium.com/yam-finance/introducing-the-umbrella-protocol-by-yam-e89109548c6d), a new risk management solution for DeFi.
*   After an attacker stole $100,000 from new fixed-rate interest project 88mph, whitehat hacker Samczsun discovered another flaw that could allow a malicious actor to drain all the ETH from 88mph‚Äôs Uniswap pool. Thanks to the tip off, the [88mph team extracted all that ETH](https://medium.com/88mphapp/88mph-mphminter-contract-issue-6365dbcacb4f) into their governance multisig (including the $100k the previously mentioned hacker left in Uniswap). 
*   Yield aggregator project [Pickle Finance](https://twitter.com/sawinyh/status/1330231595886899203) was exploited for ~$20 million worth of Dai. Check out the post-mortem report [here](https://github.com/banteg/evil-jar/blob/master/readme.md). 
*   Blockchain security firm Peckshield published an insightful write-up on the [Cheese Bank hack](https://peckshield.medium.com/cheese-bank-incident-root-cause-analysis-d076bf87a1e7), which saw an attacker make off with +$3 million in stablecoins. 
*   Is the [YFI token a security](https://lexnode.substack.com/p/why-yfi-are-not-investment-contracts) in the U.S.? That‚Äôs a big no according to a new recreational legal memo from Gabriel Shapiro. 


## üí± DEX Report

*   The minds behind the Bancor AMM have proposed a [new liquidity mining campaign](https://blog.bancor.network/announcing-bnt-liquidity-mining-b30be90a008d) that would be incentivized with BNT rewards. 
*   One of the biggest happenings in DeFi this week was the conclusion of Uniswap‚Äôs 3-month [UNI liquidity mining program](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/linked/84762/dex-uniswap-liquidity-mining-over). The incentivization effort was a success, considering the trading protocol has significantly more liquidity and volume than it did before the program started. 
*   With the conclusion of the first wave of UNI rewards, Uniswap-fork [SushiSwap](https://doseofdefi.substack.com/p/uni-rewards-halt-sushiswap-sees-inflows) has seen an acute influx of liquidity as the rival protocol began incentivizing the same trading pairs that Uniswap had been (ETH/WBTC, ETH/USDC, ETH/USDT, and ETH/DAI). 
*   [1inch.exchange](https://1inch-exchange.medium.com/liquidity-mining-update-1inch-announces-stage-2-of-liquidity-mining-program-43352f32d868), one of DeFi‚Äôs leading DEX aggregators, is rolling out the 2nd phase of its liquidity mining program.
*   DEX aggregator DEX.AG rebranded to [Slingshot](https://www.coindesk.com/dex-ag-slingshot-rebrand-funding-round). The project just fielded $3.1 million in investments, too. 
*   Don‚Äôt miss Deribit‚Äôs latest [case study on SushiSwap](https://insights.deribit.com/market-research/the-vampire-diaries-a-sushiswap-case-study/)!
*   Balancer just released [Batch #2](https://medium.com/balancer-protocol/batch-2-of-balancer-ecosystem-fund-grants-is-now-available-c6b1bf567483) of the Balancer Ecosystem Fund grants. 
*   0x-powered [Matcha](https://matcha.xyz/blog/trade-any-token) just added trading support for over 1,000 tokens. 


## üíµ State of the Stablecoins

*   Yield-centric stablecoin project Origin Protocol (OUSD) was the victim of a [flash loan attack](https://medium.com/originprotocol/urgent-ousd-has-hacked-and-there-has-been-a-loss-of-funds-7b8c4a7d534c) this week. 
*   Meet [ibDUSD](https://medium.com/defidollar/introducing-interest-bearing-defidollar-a-simple-savings-account-82576f200046), a new interest-bearing form of DefiDollar‚Äôs DUSD stablecoin.


## üíé NFT News

*   NFT minting platform and marketplace [Mintbase](https://www.coindesk.com/mintbase-raises-1m-seed-round-to-bring-nfts-to-near-protocol) raised a $1 million seed round.
