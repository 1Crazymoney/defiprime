*   Speaking of liquid Eth2 staking, C.R.E.A.M. Finance just rolled out [CRETH2](https://twitter.com/CreamdotFinance/status/1331165435052445696), a token tied to ETH tokens deposited into C.R.E.A.M. Finance‚Äôs new Eth2 validator service.
*   Nascent co-founder Dan Elitzer interviewed [Molly Wintermute](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5q_5NHO70ig&feature=youtu.be), the pseudonymous solo core dev of the Hegic options trading protocol.

*   Interest tokenization protocol Idle launched its [decentralized governance system](https://idlefinance.medium.com/idle-governance-is-live-9b55e8f407d7).


## üí± DEX Report

*   Meet [Deriswap](https://andrecronje.medium.com/deriswap-capital-efficient-swaps-futures-options-and-loans-ea424b24a41c), a new project in Yearn‚Äôs wheelhouse combining swaps, options, and loan services into a single smart contract.
*   1inch.exchange co-founder and CEO Sergej Kunz published an awesome primer on [DEX aggregators](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-are-dex-aggregators-a-deep-dive-by-1inch) through CoinMarketCap this week.
*   1inch‚Äôs next-gen AMM [Mooniswap](https://near.org/blog/mooniswap-brings-its-next-generation-amm-protocol-by-1inch-to-near/) is coming to NEAR Protocol.
*   Ethereum-based [IDEX](https://www.coindesk.com/idex-binance-smart-chain-polkadot) is bringing its tokens to Binance Smart Chance (BSC) and Polkadot.
*   The fixed-rate interest protocol [88mph published a disclosure and analysis](https://medium.com/88mphapp/the-88mph-wild-ride-e09ec56ed079) on the ‚ÄúNovember 17th incident,‚Äù which ultimately saw the 88mph team retrieve $100,000 from an attacker.

## üíµ State of the Stablecoins

*   The Dai stablecoin temporarily [rocketed up to $1.30](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/85850/dai-compound-dydx-liquidations-defi) on Coinbase as people raced to buy Dai to close or lessen their DeFi lending positions amid an acutely tanking ETH price at the time. Since Compound relies on Coinbase as a price oracle, this buy pressure led to over $88 million worth of liquidations on the lending protocol.

*   The artist Pak just sold ‚ÄúM√∂bius Knot‚Äù on Ethereum‚Äôs leading cryptoart platform SuperRare for [77 ETH](https://twitter.com/SuperRare_co/status/1333083621553561600) (~$42,7200). In dollar terms, it was SuperRare‚Äôs 2nd-largest USD sale to date.
*   Leading NFT marketplace [OpenSea](https://twitter.com/opensea/status/1331990631024091142) has supported nearly $30 million in volume as of this week.
