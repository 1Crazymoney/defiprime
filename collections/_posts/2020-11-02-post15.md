Want to mine some yield farming knowledge? We‚Äôre leaking alpha. Check out defiprime‚Äôs new [Alpha DeFi](https://alpha.defiprime.com/c/yield-farming/6) community forum, where we just launched some great new guides on [BOND](https://alpha.defiprime.com/t/yield-farming-with-bond-barnbridge/631), [SWRV](https://alpha.defiprime.com/t/yield-farming-with-swerve/339), and more.


## üî• The DeFi Bulletin

*   Lending protocol [Aave is going fully decentralized](https://medium.com/aave/aave-admin-key-handover-3e09e603d348), as the Aave team is passing off the project‚Äôs admin key to the community-run Aave Governance system. 
*   Yield aggregator project [Harvest Finance](https://decrypt.co/46303/harvest-finance-issue-100000-bounty-on-hacker) issued a $100,000 bounty (which they promptly upped to [$1 million](https://www.coindesk.com/harvest-finance-boosts-bounty-to-1m-for-information-leading-to-return-of-exploited-funds)) for evidence leading to the arrest of the culprit who stole millions of dollars from the protocol this week using a sophisticated flashloan maneuver.
*   Harvest Finance published its [post-mortem report](https://medium.com/harvest-finance/harvest-flashloan-economic-attack-post-mortem-3cf900d65217) on the aforementioned attack.
*   More fixed-rate debt markets are coming to DeFi courtesy of [Notional‚Äôs new beta](https://medium.com/notional-finance/notional-brings-fixed-rates-to-ethereum-47b384cdb980), which is now live on the Ethereum mainnet. 
*   [B.Protocol](https://medium.com/b-protocol/b-protocol-is-live-8d0971b77ef9), a decentralized backstop liquidity protocol, is now live. The project aims to help users ‚Äúmake more with their Maker Vaults.‚Äù

Now, calls are growing in the community to shield against this kind of highly-abusable maneuvering.

*   Social money startup [Roll](https://medium.com/roll-protocol/were-bringing-a-new-type-of-capital-to-creators-7879bf2715b5) (which launches personal tokens as ERC-20s atop Ethereum) just raised $1 million in a new investment round. 
*   SCB 10X, the venture division of Thailand‚Äôs Siam Commercial Bank, is teaming up with Alpha Homora creators [Alpha Finance Labs](https://decrypt.co/46585/siam-commercial-bank-in-thailand-delves-into-defi) to collaborate on DeFi projects.
