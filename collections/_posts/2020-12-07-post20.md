## üî• The DeFi Bulletin

*   Meet [xAAVE](https://medium.com/xtoken/introducing-xaave-mandated-governance-81d0cdb8ee7e): an automated Aave staking token that generates the same returns as stkAAVE but without having to go through the protocol‚Äôs manual AAVE staking process.
*   Speaking of Aave, the project just launched its improved [V2 protocol](https://medium.com/aave/the-aave-protocol-v2-f06f299cee04).
*   U.S. crypto exchange giant Coinbase is rolling out an [ETH2 derivative product](https://blog.coinbase.com/ethereum-2-0-staking-rewards-are-coming-soon-to-coinbase-a25d8ac622d5), so its users can enjoy liquidity while simultaneously serving as an Ethereum staker. [Binance](https://www.binance.com/en/support/announcement/a640a714e067433abae871f6b621836f) is launching its own ETH2 derivative, too.
*   Get ready, because [S&P Dow Jones Indices](https://www.reuters.com/article/cryptocurrencies-sp/sp-dow-jones-indices-to-launch-cryptocurrency-indexes-in-2021-idUSL1N2IJ0TG) is launching cryptocurrency-based indexes next year. 
*   Popular DeFi lending protocol [Maker](https://blog.makerdao.com/governance-polls-november-30-2020/) is in the process of vetting new supported collateral types, like UNI and renBTC. 
*   Fireblocks expanded its ‚Äú[Fireblocks DeFi](https://www.fireblocks.com/blog/fireblocks-defi-for-institutional-trading-lending-and-staking/)‚Äù service to support all DeFi apps.
*   With all the talk of [Yearn‚Äôs DeFi collaborations](https://andrecronje.medium.com/merger-acquisition-partnership-collaboration-nomenclature-in-the-decentralized-space-ca24370d6f27) lately, Yearn creator Andre Cronje published a primer explaining how to make sense of the yield aggregator protocol‚Äôs recent partnerships.
*   Be sure to check out the [uLABS Gas Futures Token](https://medium.com/uma-project/ulabs-gas-futures-token-9f51682778dd), a new tool for speculating on Ethereum gas prices. 
*   Tim Roughgarden‚Äôs economic analysis of [EIP-1559](http://timroughgarden.org/papers/eip1559.pdf) is out! The takeaway? This fee mechanism is a viable way forward. 
*   DeFi derivatives trading protocol [DerivaDEX](https://medium.com/derivadex/insurance-mining-with-derivadex-a8c3b65d9548) just launched an insurance mining campaign. 
*   Crypto venture firm [Variant](https://variant.fund/leadership-in-the-ownership-economy/) wrote how DeFi teams can stay closely involved with their projects through the ‚Äúdemocratic structure of member-owned cooperatives.‚Äù
*   Andre Cronje‚Äôs [Keep3r](https://andrecronje.medium.com/scaling-keep3r-with-chainlink-2832bbc76506) project is scaling thanks to Chainlink‚Äôs decentralized oracles. 
*   Elastic supply project [Ampleforth](https://www.ampltalk.org/app/forum/announcements-22/topic/multichain-ampleforth-231/) is expanding to the Tron, Polkadot, and NEAR blockchains. 
*   [Kraken](https://blog.kraken.com/post/6988/ethereum-hodlers-earn-staking-rewards-and-support-the-upgrade-to-ethereum-2-0/) launched its own Eth2 staking service. 


## üí± DEX Report

*   Yearn now has an AMM arm thanks to a [new collaboration with SushiSwap](https://medium.com/iearn/yearn-x-sushi-%E8%A1%8C%E3%81%A3%E3%81%A6%E3%81%8D%E3%81%BE%E3%81%99-41b2f78b62e9). As such, the DEX can now be thought of as Yearn‚Äôs in-house trading protocol. 
*   To address the shortcomings of AMMs for liquidity providers, the new [Peanut](https://medium.com/peanut-trade/introducing-peanut-a-defi-price-balancer-that-increases-crypto-lp-income-1955a1d2fa07) project is out and functions as an ‚Äúadvanced price balancer pool‚Äù system for DeFi. 
*   Should Uniswap‚Äôs [UNI liquidity mining campaign](https://www.theblockcrypto.com/amp/post/86082/uniswap-liquidity-incentives-proposal) be recontinued? Mika Honkasalo had a great write-up on why restarting this campaign may not be shrewd right now. 
*   DEX aggregator project [1inch.exchange](https://1inch-exchange.medium.com/1inch-successfully-closes-12-mln-funding-round-led-by-pantera-capital-4c8a5a421ea8) just closed a new $12 million funding round led by Pantera Capital. 
*   Loopring launched its [zkRollups-based AMM](https://medium.com/loopring-protocol/looprings-zkrollup-amm-is-live-2f8251cd0fcd). 


## üíµ State of the Stablecoins

*   Inspired by the Basis stablecoin project of yore, [Basis Cash](https://www.coindesk.com/basis-cash-algorithmic-stablecoin-launch-defi-rick-morty) is a new algorithmic stablecoin project that functions as a sort of DeFi central bank. 
*   The recently proposed STABLE Act would require stablecoin projects to receive a banking charter to operate in America. Coin Center aptly argued [why the draft bill is nonsense](https://blog.kraken.com/post/6988/ethereum-hodlers-earn-staking-rewards-and-support-the-upgrade-to-ethereum-2-0/). 
*   Binance listed Synthetix‚Äôs [sUSD](https://research.binance.com/en/projects/susd). 


## üíé NFT News

*   Andreesen Horowitz hosted cryptoartists Pak and Signe Pierce for a talk about [NFTs](https://a16z.com/2020/11/22/crypto-for-creators-tokenized-collectibles-nfts/).
