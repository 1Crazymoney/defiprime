*   Yield aggregator project yEarn unveiled the [SyntheticRebaseDollar](https://medium.com/iearn/introducing-syntheticrebasedollar-a-credit-based-rebase-index-7e6e0ce7c24), an ‚Äúauto rebasing index that tracks the dollar value of the collateral that creates it.‚Äù
*   Margin trading and lending project bZx [reclaimed $8 million](https://www.coindesk.com/bzx-reclaims-8m-hack) that was stolen in an iToken duplication attack last week.
*   dHEDGE, an asset management platform underpinned by Synthetix, launched its [DHT token generation event](https://medium.com/dhedge-org/dht-token-generation-event-e0af6eb6b10) on the Gnosis-powered Mesa trading interface.
