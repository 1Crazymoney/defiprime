### Hello! What's your background, and what are you working on?

Hi! I’m Mingda Lei but everyone calls me [Radar Bear](https://twitter.com/bear_radar). I’m the CEO of [DODO](https://dodoex.io/), which has been a great outlet for my passion and experience in blockchain technology, especially around DeFi.

Before DODO, I was an integral member of the DDEX.io team, where I developed much of its smart contract infrastructure. I also graduated with a bachelor’s degree from Peking University, double majoring in astrophysics and economics. So I’ve been thinking about macroeconomics, finance, mathematics and science for quite some time!

At DODO, we’ve been working on a new project that extends our existing decentralized exchange into another vibrant area of DeFi: NFTs. Typically associated with art, there are all kinds of ways that NFTs will be deployed in our industry in the coming months and years.

We’re excited to contribute our core strengths to the NFT ecosystem. Namely, doing the same thing as DODO DEX itself: offering  accessible financial services and the ability to trade assets in a permissionless and decentralized manner.

[DODO NFT](https://dodonft.io/) has two notable features:

1. DODO Drops: Issuing new NFT assets, bridging the real world consensus to the on-chain world, digital assets backed by blockchain technology
2. DODO Fractionalize: Providing liquidity for NFT assets: fractionalization (turning non-fungible tokens into fungible tokens), next-generation fans tokens, membership of collections; tech: utilizing PMM, cost-effective way to issue new token assets for trading.

There are also three types of users. First, we have our Issuers or people who want to issue their NFT assets onto DODO NFT. Second, we have Collectors who purchase and collect sets of NFTs with the ultimate goal of expanding their collections. Third, we have Traders, who are looking to profit by buying and selling highly liquid NFT assets, often related to a specific artist, genre, or other well-known creators.

### What's DODO NFT backstory?

Our goal with building DODO NFT is to further serve our growing community of crypto users by bridging the real world and digital assets gap. We want to make it easier for people to both understand and benefit from the nascent NFT ecosystem.

We came up with the idea at the beginning of 2021, just before the “NFT Spring” that saw NFT sales skyrocket. In fact, we did not expect NFTs to become so popular so quickly!

With so many innovative and inspiring NFT ideas coming to fruition, we wanted to solve the issuance and liquidity challenges. So we jumped in and started building. We’ve now iterated and refined DODO NFT so that it’s well-positioned as a unique platform in the market today.

We also saw an innovative use case for our [Proactive Market Maker](https://medium.com/dodoex/proactive-market-making-algorithm-a-universal-liquidity-framework-4dec7fae7091), a universal liquidity framework that enables DODO to offer better liquidity than other DEXs. It’s also an opportunity to expand the real-world asset types supported by DODO. We see a bright future for the trading of all kinds of digital assets within decentralized exchanges!

On the financing front, DODO NFT is a part of DODO, which is backed by Framework, Binance Labs, [among others](https://defiprime.com/dodo).


### What went into building DODO NFT?

The DODO NFT team is 7-person strong, with our world-class engineering team tackling the project from diverse backgrounds and perspectives. We’ve also leveraged DODO’s market research team, our advisory board, and other related resources- especially our rich IP connections in the real world, including esports, soccer, celebrities, animes, and more.

The team took about three months from conceptualization to product fruition, slated for a late June release. We’ve already launched DODO NFT Drops v1.0 with three successful sales: Yui Hatano, Marvel (KAKA), and Fear. The Hatano and Fear drops sold out, with Hatano’s pulling in $1 million, Marvel making $830k in sales, and Fear collecting $230k.

Although the market is rapidly changing, NFTs are here to stay. I have strong confidence in this industry and will continue building more features and working with awesome teams!

Like all product launches, the main challenges are always adoption and awareness. We’ve also carefully audited our security, alongside the instrumental help of DODO Advisor Jerry Zhou and our DODO community, who assisted with alpha testing and quality of life improvements.

There are also infrastructure challenges, such as cross-chain limitations in which NFTs purchased on ETH cannot be used on BSC. This complexity limits mainstream adoption. We need unified NFT standards to give NFT users more utilities, such as in the metaverse or gaming.

One challenge unique to NFTs is that as values ballooned, it excluded many everyday traders while rewarding whales. That will have to change if we want NFTs to reach their full potential!


### How does DODO NFT fit into the broader NFT economy?

The NFT boom may have subsided somewhat, but we remain bullish. A frothy environment has given way to more experimentation and potential, with transformative projects on the horizon. The current correction and retracement is simply a sign of a healthy economy.

The broader context is most important. NFTs are now recognized as a new asset class, with sports clubs and esports teams creating fan tokens. There’s also TSM sponsorship, and of course, the runaway success of NBA Topshot.

As content creators, celebrities, and artists make their works as NFTs, it will disrupt the traditional entertainment industries. We’ve already seen examples from Shawn Mendes, Mark Cuban, 3LAU, Lindsay Lohan, Paris Hilton, Michael Owen, Snoop Dogg, Jack Dorsey, and many others.

Given the ongoing experimentation, we’re confident that NFTs are an emerging new asset class and will be widely accepted as a new asset class and embraced by the mainstream.

More specifically, NFT utilities won’t be limited to art only or even within the metaverse. There will be many more financial applications for NFTs and more synergies with DeFi (such as lending, borrowing, and staking, which has already begun). To prepare for this near future, we’ve made our DODO NFT Vaults composable with other DeFi protocols, which gives our community the most optionality possible.


### What's your business model?

We have two parts of our business model. For DODO Drops, we take a small commission for each sale. Also, certain special sales can only be purchased with DODO tokens with discounts for vDODO token holders. [vDODO](https://dodoex.github.io/docs/docs/dodonomics) is our loyalty program, which includes benefits like governance rights, IDO allocations, trading fee discounts, membership rewards, and exclusive dividends from trading fees.

For DODO Fractionalize, there are trading fees collected from NFT trades and buyouts. We also bootstrap the liquidity markets. In the future, similar to DODO Crowdpooling, we will distribute fractionalized tokens at the beginning of the campaign.

### What’s your position on the regulatory landscape today?

For digital products, there is no particular significant regulatory problem. The blockchain documents and protects the original copyrights and ownership, which is a huge plus.

The main potential hurdle is when real-world assets are on-boarded onto the blockchain as NFTs. That process can be tricky, especially for tangible financial assets, which may be regulated at the local, regional and national levels.

For us at DODO NFT, we will continue to pay close attention to this area and ensure full regulatory compliance so that our users are protected. For us at the corporate level, DODO is incorporated in Singapore and is subject to all applicable Singaporean financial regulations and laws.


### What are your goals for the future?

To set ourselves apart from others in the market, we will build on what’s been so special about DODO: a brand that’s fun yet functional coupled with our state-of-the-art Proactive Market Maker algorithm and deep expertise and experience in DeFi.

We will also expand DODO token utilities to encompass the DODO NFT platform and give token holders more value accrual. That’s going to be a promising new value-add for our community.

Finally, we will continue our focus on partnerships and integrations. These will allow us to expand our reach in collaboration with top-tier NFT exchanges, especially Binance NFT. We’ll also integrate with multiple chains, including Ethereum, BSC, Arbitrum, and Polygon, among others. We’ve already been doing these extensive integrations for DODO, as we’re firm believers in the multi-chain future of crypto.


### What are your future thoughts on the DeFi market?

DeFi will continue to thrive! We’ve barely scratched the surface of its potential. As DeFi infrastructure matures, traditional assets will take advantage of DeFi. The resulting synergies will allow an entirely new crop of innovations to bloom, further accelerating the growth of the DeFi space.

There are also promising signs of the growing acceptance of digital assets and crypto. In the case of El Salvador, we’ll see more individuals previously unfamiliar with crypto will be more involved in the world of blockchain and NFTs.

I believe that crypto will continue to see much wider adoption and become competitive with fiat soon. Who knows, maybe one day crypt will overtake fiat completely! Only time will tell.
