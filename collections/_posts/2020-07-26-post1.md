This is the 1st issue of _The Defiprime Post_, a quick weekly primer covering the biggest developments around Ethereum and DeFi. This week’s issue covers events between July 19th and July 26th, 2020.


## 🔥 The DeFi Bulletin

The project’s YFI farming campaign [took the DeFi arena by storm](https://twitter.com/VentureCoinist/status/1286784984368349184) this week, and the [YFI governance forum](https://twitter.com/Cooopahtroopa/status/1285080765198487553) launched.
*   Looking for a good YFI overview? [CoastalDegen](https://twitter.com/CoastalDegener1/status/1286404098179432450) and[ weeb](https://medium.com/@Weeb_Mcgee/yfi-explained-by-weeb-90a4e545aa3e) have you covered.
*   On July 23rd, Aave flipped Compound to notch the [#2 position](https://twitter.com/defiprime/status/1286335271987040258) on DeFi Pulse’s TVL leaderboard for the first time ever. Compound’s since acutely reclaimed the #2 spot, but the competitiveness shows Aave’s becoming a DeFi tour de force
*   Ethereum devs published the specs for the [final ETH 2.0 testnet](https://blog.ethereum.org/2020/07/23/eth2-quick-update-no-13/).
*   The WBTC ecosystem added [new merchants](https://twitter.com/WrappedBTC/status/1286094521332244482), including Alameda, imToken, and Three Arrows Capital. There’s now more than 18,000 bitcoin (~$180 million) tokenized on Ethereum, with the [majority of that supply](https://twitter.com/jpurd17/status/1286310982453780480) coming via WBTC.
*   Synthetix kicked off its [Antares](https://blog.synthetix.io/the-antares-release/) release, which optimizes UX around trading binary options on Synthetix.Exchange. Several firms, including Framework and Three Arrows Capital, are now serving as [liquidity providers](https://blog.synthetix.io/institutional-liquidity-providers-join-synthetix/) on Synthetix as well.
*   dHedge, a Synthetix-based asset management protocol, [emerged out of stealth](https://medium.com/@dhedgeorg/dhedge-invest-like-the-best-6fcb5ff9370f).
*   The mStable community was sent buzzing after an [unexpected supply movement](https://twitter.com/defiprime/status/1285593541901606913) of MTA, mStable’s protocol token, sowed confusion.
*   Zapper.fi is becoming a [major DeFi liquidity facilitator](https://twitter.com/NodarJ/status/1287120146927177735).

*   Crypto derivatives exchange FTX released spot markets and futures for [$AMPL](https://twitter.com/defiprime/status/1286312765712240640).

## 💵 State of the Stablecoins
