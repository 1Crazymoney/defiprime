Welcome to the 16th issue of _The Defiprime Post_, a quick weekly primer covering the biggest developments around Ethereum and DeFi. This week‚Äôs issue covers events between November 1st and November 8th, 2020.

Want to mine some yield farming knowledge? We‚Äôre leaking alpha. Check out defiprime‚Äôs new [Alpha DeFi](https://alpha.defiprime.com/c/yield-farming/6) community forum, where we just launched some great new guides on [BOND](https://alpha.defiprime.com/t/yield-farming-with-bond-barnbridge/631), [SWRV](https://alpha.defiprime.com/t/yield-farming-with-swerve/339), and more.


## üî• The DeFi Bulletin

*   Ethereum‚Äôs developers released the [Eth2 deposit contract address](https://blog.ethereum.org/2020/11/04/eth2-quick-update-no-19/), so the network‚Äôs biggest evolution yet is now just around the corner. For anyone interested, _Bankless_ just published a [great guide](https://bankless.substack.com/p/-guide-how-to-become-a-validator) on becoming an Eth2 validator.
*   The Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) is holding a panel discussion on ‚Äú[digital assets, derivatives, and DeFi](https://twitter.com/CFTC/status/1323648673037864962)‚Äù on November 17th.
*   KeeperDAO, a group centered around liquidity providers and keepers (think liquidators and arbitrageurs), introduced its [ROOK governance token](https://medium.com/keeperdao/caro-kann-introducing-rook-liquidity-mining-arbitrage-mining-adbe319905fd) as well as associated ROOK liquidity mining and arbitrage mining campaigns.
*   Crypto investments firm Paradigm published an [interview with Andre Cronje](https://medium.com/paradigm-fund/interview-with-andre-cronje-defi-architect-and-creator-of-yearn-finance-eee82d1ef849), the creator of the hit yield aggregator protocol yEarn.
*   Uniswap‚Äôs Matteo Leibowitz has an amazing ‚Äú[Uniswap: Community](https://www.duneanalytics.com/MatteoLeibowitz/uniswap-community)‚Äù dashboard up on Dune Analytics. If you haven‚Äôt seen this one before, do check it out!
*   The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) harmonized and simplified its [exempt offerings framework](https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2020-273). The rule changes will likely lead to security tokens and security token offerings becoming more common around DeFi.
*   The yEarn community is exploring restructuring the [fees of yEarn Vaults](https://gov.yearn.finance/t/restructure-fees-and-align-incentives/7548), with the idea of replacing these Vaults‚Äô withdrawal fees with management fees recently gaining traction.
*   Binance listed Keep3r Network‚Äôs [KP3R token](https://www.binance.com/en/support/announcement/1c8ac2f4ca3f42189bcf7e000629c666). The project also just announced that it‚Äôs going to be relying on [Uniquote oracles](https://andrecronje.medium.com/keep3r-network-on-chain-oracle-price-feeds-3c67ed002a9).
*   You‚Äôve heard of liquidity mining? On-chain synthetic assets project UMA Protocol just launched a ‚Äú[developer mining](https://medium.com/uma-project/uma-announces-developer-mining-6f6fe15d5604)‚Äù program, in which 50,000 UMA tokens will be distributed weekly to devs who create assets using the protocol.
*   [Razor Network](https://www.coindesk.com/razor-network-oracles-funding-round), a decentralized oracle project, just raised $3.7 million from investors like Alameda Research and Spark Digital Capital.
*   Speaking of oracles, 29 of Chainlink‚Äôs 315 project integrations to date came [last month alone](https://decrypt.co/46918/29-projects-integrated-with-chainlink-last-month).
*   Lending protocol [Percent Money](https://percent-finance.medium.com/important-announcement-d35f9a0df112) accidentally froze its USDC, WBTC, and ETH markets, which in turn locked in some users‚Äô funds.
*   _defiprime_ interviewed [Yam Finance‚Äôs Trent Elmore](https://defiprime.com/yam) as well as Romain Rouphael, a co-founder of [LN Markets](https://defiprime.com/lnmarkets). The industry publication also just published a great explainer on [DeFi indexes](https://defiprime.com/defi-index).
*   There‚Äôs a new DeFi index on the scene, [PieDAO‚Äôs DEFI++](https://medium.com/piedao/announcing-defi-and-a-comparative-index-performance-analysis-9f63e251120d), which has a 70/30 weighting between large-cap and small-cap DeFi tokens.


## üí± DEX Report

*   Dharma‚Äôs proposal to distribute nearly $12 million worth of UNI tokens (over the matter of proxy smart contracts that missed out on Uniswap‚Äôs initial UNI airdrop) failed because [not enough users participated](https://www.coindesk.com/uniswap-proposal-to-airdrop-more-uni-falls-short-in-governance-vote) in the relevant Uniswap governance vote.
*   Decentralized market protocol [Switcheo](https://blog.switcheo.network/switcheo-secures-investment-in-strategic-round-led-by-defiance-capital/) raised $1.2 million from DeFiance Capital, Three Arrows Capital, and more.
*   1inch.exchange introduced [1inch v2](https://1inch-exchange.medium.com/introducing-1inch-v2-defis-fastest-and-most-advanced-aggregation-protocol-c42573dc3f85), the decentralized exchange aggregator‚Äôs new optimized infrastructure.
*   ParaFi Capital made a strategic investment in [BNT](https://blog.bancor.network/parafi-invests-in-bnt-to-advance-bancor-protocol-growth-7f79fab40c81), the native token of the Bancor trading protocol.


## üíµ State of the Stablecoins

*   USDC issuer Circle is planning to release ‚Äúmedium-term high-yield interest rate business accounts‚Äù that will be underpinned by the [USDC stablecoin](https://twitter.com/circlepay/status/1324413482662592512) and DeFi.
*   Curve launched a [DUSD pool](https://twitter.com/defidollar/status/1324193293438128129), a metapool between DefiDollar‚Äôs index-based stablecoin DUSD and Curve‚Äôs increasingly popular 3pool (Dai, USDC, USDT). The pool‚Äôs being incentivized with 95,000 DFD, DefiDollar‚Äôs governance token, weekly right now.


## üíé NFT News

*   [Mintable](https://mintable.medium.com/a-new-type-of-dao-for-nfts-by-nfts-9859253dd823), the first ‚ÄúNFT-only‚Äù DAO, has arrived. The group relies on NFTs for its governance, in that members use NFTs to make proposals and vote on proposals.
*   [NIFTEX](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/niftex-raises-%24500k-to-build-out-nft-trading-platform-2020-11-03), an exchange platform for trading fractionalized NFTs, just raised its first $500k in funding.
