Welcome to the 10th issue of _The Defiprime Post_, a quick weekly primer covering the biggest developments around Ethereum and DeFi. This week‚Äôs issue covers events between September 20th and September 27th, 2020.

Want to mine some yield farming knowledge? We‚Äôre leaking alpha. Check out defiprime‚Äôs new [Alpha DeFi](https://alpha.defiprime.com/c/yield-farming/6) community forum, where we just launched some great new guides on [PERP](https://alpha.defiprime.com/t/perp-usdc-lp-reward-program/477), [SWRV](https://alpha.defiprime.com/t/yield-farming-with-swerve/339), and more.

## üî• The DeFi Bulletin

*   Phil Liu, the chief legal officer of investment manager Arca, published a piece arguing that [Uniswap‚Äôs UNI](https://www.ar.ca/blog/are-uni-tokens-subject-to-securities-enforcement-action-by-the-sec) ‚Äúmay very well be outside the enforcement framework of U.S. securities laws.‚Äù
*   New yield farming aggregator project [APY.Finance](https://www.coindesk.com/defi-yield-farming-aggregator-apy-finance-raises-3-6m-in-seed-funding) raised $3.6 million in a seed funding round.
*   Now that the Yam Finance ‚ÄúReplanting‚Äù was successful and YAM rebases are flowing once again, the project‚Äôs builders are eyeing [new improvements](https://medium.com/yam-finance/yams-replanted-and-rebased-what-now-a22672b81b55) around treasury management, usability, and more.
*   Synthetic assets project [Synthetix](https://blog.synthetix.io/the-shifting-sands-of-defi/) is prioritizing efforts around alleviating gas prices and maintaining sUSD‚Äôs $1 peg.
*   Trustless tokenized bitcoin project [tBTC](https://blog.keep.network/tbtc-the-safe-way-to-use-bitcoin-in-defi-is-live-on-tbtc-network-de2bb8b6eaf7) relaunched.
*   bZx co-founder Kyle Kistner was the latest guest on [Chris Blec‚Äôs Trust Bubble](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6Elx3aOudY&feature=youtu.be) show, which centers around ‚Äúhonest and hard-hitting conversation‚Äù on topical DeFi matters.
*   Set Protocol introduced yield farming strategies on TokenSets. The first such offering, the [ETH USD Yield Farm](https://medium.com/set-protocol/introducing-yield-farming-strategies-on-tokensets-60d114e0172c), automatically farms UNI by providing liquidity to Uniswap‚Äôs ETH/DAI liquidity pool.
*   Be sure to check out ‚Äú[The State of 1559](https://hackmd.io/@timbeiko/1559-update-001),‚Äù the first community update on EIP-1559‚Äôs progress. If implemented, this EIP would significantly improve Ethereum‚Äôs fee market.
*   BarnBridge, a cross-platform protocol for tokenizing risk, announced a [two-phased liquidity mining campaign](https://medium.com/barnbridge/yield-farming-and-lp-incentivization-25eba3f55ec4) around the $BOND token.
*   General front-running [arbitrage bots](https://zengo.com/generalized-front-running-ethereum-arbitrage-bot-attack/) have surfaced in DeFi. These bots can ‚Äúidentify profitable DeFi transactions and kill them by getting there first and claiming this profit.‚Äù
*   The Graph Network team released a post outlining the tokenomics of its coming [GRT token](https://thegraph.com/blog/the-graph-grt-token-economics).
*   Hedge fund manager [Three Arrows Capital](https://www.coindesk.com/three-arrows-capital-record-wrapped-bitcoin-mint?amp=1&__twitter_impression=true) minted 2,316 WBTC via BitGo on Thursday, September 24th.
*   Optimism unveiled the [Optimistic Ethereum Testnet](https://medium.com/@optimismPBC/light-at-the-end-of-the-tunnel-c390a05bbcb8), which Synthetix is already testing out. The testnet indicates that a mainnet version of the layer-two scaling tech is now just around the corner.
*   New York-based crypto exchange [Gemini](https://gemini.com/blog/gemini-to-support-new-defi-tokens) listed a range of DeFi tokens, including SNX, UNI, YFI, and more.
*   Meet [Rails](https://medium.com/rails-ethereums-layer-2/rails-a-new-l2-product-from-loopring-and-dxdao-enables-gas-free-ethereum-transfers-3975789a706d), a new layer-two scaling solution owned by DXdao that will enable instant and gas-free Ethereum transfers.
*   The [first Aave AIP](https://medium.com/aave/the-governance-is-in-your-hands-vote-on-the-first-aip-7037af6fcae1) is here, and it‚Äôs focused on kickstarting the planned LEND to AAVE token migration.

*   defiprime published an ‚Äú[Ethereum Gas Explained](https://defiprime.com/gas)‚Äù primer this week. If you‚Äôre ever helping anyone try and better understand how Ethereum works, it‚Äôs a great share.


## üí± DEX Report

*   On-chain liquidity protocol Kyber Network went on a DeFi spree in adding support for [CREAM, CRV, SUSHI, SWRV, UNI, YFI, and YFV](https://blog.kyber.network/cream-uni-sushi-crv-yfi-yfv-and-swrv-are-now-available-on-kyber-network-116c29d06262).
